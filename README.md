# MMKV Widget Demo

A demonstration project showcasing the integration of MMKV (Memory-Mapped Key-Value) storage with iOS widgets. This project uses Expo and demonstrates how to share data between your main app and iOS widgets using MMKV storage.

## Features

- MMKV storage integration for efficient data persistence
- iOS Widget support
- Data sharing between main app and iOS widgets
- Built with Expo and React Native
